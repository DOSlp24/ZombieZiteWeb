        <p class="centered">Welcome to the world of ZombieZite, an amazing game where you fight for your survival.</p>
        <p>ZombieZite is a nice mix of RPG and turn based strategy. Up to four characters enter an arena, trying not to
            get eaten by Zombies. Stop the undead by shooting them in the head. There are plenty Weapons to choose from!
            But be careful: There is friendly-fire, so are up for teamwork or a rogue?</p>
        <p>Lay out your strategy. Where do you want to fight the Zombies? Which Weapons are you using? Always keep a
            cool head and watch out for these runners.</p>
        <p>Move your character around with the <span class="aboutMove">ARROW buttons</span> on the screen.</p>
        <p>You can find loot anywhere in the arena. With the <span class="aboutSearch">SEARCH</span> button you pick up
            the nearest item.</p>
        <p>Take a strategical break with the <span class="aboutWait">WAIT button</span>.</p>
        <p><span class="aboutAttack">Attack</span> by clicking a field in the arena which is highlighted
            <span class="aboutAttack">RED</span>.</p>
        <p>Find different Armor and Weapons to defend yourself. Some Zombies have evolved, but you will find that out
            soon enough.</p>
        <p>Jump in right now by clicking New Game!</p>
